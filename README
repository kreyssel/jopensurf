This is a pretty small set of code, folks were having trouble getting it to work correctly (to be fair I forgot a couple of files ;)) so I included an ant buildfile. It's really only got three commands:

ant compile - This will compile the files

ant example - This will run an example which will show and compare the interest points for two images of the White House

ant clean - Cleans out the build directory files
