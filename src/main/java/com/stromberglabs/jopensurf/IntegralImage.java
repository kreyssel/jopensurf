 * ABOUT generateIntegralImage
 * 
 * When OpenSURF stores it's version of the integral image, some slight rounding actually
 * occurs, it doesn't maintain the same values from when it calculates the integral image
 * to when it calls BoxIntegral on the same data
 * @author astromberg
 *
 * Example from C++ OpenSURF - THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE JAVA VERSION
 * 
 * IntegralImage Values at Calculation Time:
 * integralImage[11][9] = 33.69019699
 * integralImage[16][9] = 47.90196228
 * integralImage[11][18] = 65.84313202
 * integralImage[16][18] = 93.58038330
 * 
 * 
 * integralImage[11][18] = 65.84313202
 * que? integralImage[18][11] = 64.56079102
 * 
 * IntegralImage Values at BoxIntegral Time:
 * img[11][9] = 33.83921814
 * img[11][18] = 64.56079102
 * img[16][9] = 48.76078796
 * img[16][18] = 93.03530884
